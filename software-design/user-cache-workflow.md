## ðŸ“Š User Data Cache Worflow

The user data is limited to avoid abuse by users on `/dashboard`. It is cached by Redis once rate limit reached to keep data filled. 
<br >
The current algorithm that is employed is the Token Bucket algorithm (basic), look at diagram to understand how it is implemented in DailySAT.
<br >
The code associated to this workflow is implemented on `/src/app/api/auth/get-user/route.ts`
